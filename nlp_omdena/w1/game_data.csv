"God of War (2018)","age 17+","While God of War used to be an ultra-violent and gory video game series, the latest entry has changed a lot. Not only has the violence been toned down a lot, but the game now has a more mature storyline. In the first few games, players were tasked with hunting down gods from Greek mythology and killing these deities out of hate. God of War 2018, on the other hand, features a main character who wants to scatter his wife's ashes with his son. Kratos (the protagonist) seeks redemption for the violence he has committed.
The content is still violent, but decidedly less so. There is no drinking or use of substances. There is some minor swearing, such as b****, but any bad language is kept to a minimum. There are no sexual scenes.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","Gone are the days of Kratos over the top, cartoonish anger issues along with the gratuitous vulgarity and offputting nudity of past games.....And THAT is a very good thing. The action is more engaging, grounded and visceral than ever with a third person 'over the shoulder' camera angle. There is a more one on one approach to combat this time instead of mowing down hordes, ala Dynasty Warriors, with the enemy types being detailed and gritty, although repeats and repaints are frequent.
To equip for your questing, Kratos' armor &amp; weapons as well as his sons clothes and bow are upgradable along the journey. There are many moves and attacks to attain along the way with plenty of ways to dispatch enemies with multiple skill trees. Kratos axe reacts like Thors hammer from the Marvel franchise and returns to his hand when thrown with a single button press. Kratos also uses his bare hands and retractable shield for attacks and combos while Kratos son, Atreyu, fires sometimes by himself, but also on your command with the same onscreen reticle as your axe. Later on you obtain Kratos' traditional GoW weapon as well adding a ""fire element"" weapon to your Frost Axe, which later comes into play with elemental enemies. In battle, Atreyu will frequently yell out warnings to incoming attacks which is complimented by onscreen, directional reticles that turn color as enemies approach.
To tie it all together the story in surprisingly very well done, heartfelt and engaging which drives you to experience each step. I think the one thing I truly loved is the father, son dynamic. It is interesting, gritty and and seems to bring to life and encompass it's beautiful, yet often harsh surroundings. It truly feels like a expansive, very cinematic journey.
One ""gripe"" I had initially was that the controls cannot be customized. The right trigger buttons are the attack buttons and holding the left trigger gives you a reticle to throw and shoot with using those same action buttons. There is no ""jump"" button, but Kratos traverses with an action button which causes him to leap or climb when needed. There is also a dodge, a 2 stick button 'god rage' mode for overwhelming situations and a block, parry mechanic that is also used in Kratos' hand to hand combos. The fact that the game has a 4 tiered difficulty setting which you can change at any time is a nice and welcome touch making it accessible to everyone and challenging for those who want it.
To sum it up, the best description I've heard is that this game is ""Dark Souls would be if it was approachable and accessible"". The somewhat slower pace but more visceral execution of combat sets it apart from the series prior entries and Kratos' engagement strategies have a larger arsenal with a more thoughtful and gritty interaction that makes it feel all the more real and threatening. This is not a hyper paced hack and slash or DMC/Bayonetta style game, but if you enjoy those then there's a good chance you may enjoy this one as well, the change of pace might do you good. HOWEVER, be forewarned that bosses are repeated, especially in the later half with 9 of a very similar type are needed to be tracked down, each of which will test your knowledge of the game mechanics and ability to discern patterns, openings and tactics. It may become exhausting to many, it definitely did for me. I'm still not sure if I will get the time or motivation to actually wrap it up myself.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","NOT AS BAD AS PREVIOUS GOD OF WARS. The violence is toned down considerably, some guts can still be seen if you do a glory kill, avoid those and you should be fine. The language is minimal, the only bad language is when you trade with brock who uses the f word sometimes. The story is great there is no sexual content, but Kratos does mistreat his child sometimes, not physically, but he just isn't a good dad. Kratos is a great role model, because he is trying to bury his wife and strengthen the bond with his kid, and he never kills if he doesn't have to",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","Very good story and gameplay",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","God of War takes a huge risk by completely reshaping the formula that has defined its past game. The result is emotionally compelling story about a father and son. Gameplay is as fluid as ever, even though its not as fast as previous games. Also l, unlike its previous games there is no sex and swearing is very limited. Suitable for teens.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","This game has managed to turn an anti-hero into a (slightly) good role model for kids. Yes, there is combat in this game, and the protagonist almost always kills. However, the violence is toned down both because Kratos doesn't want to scare his kid and because the enemies are coloured blue or orange, which makes the deaths look cartoony.
The other positive is that the main character seeks to protect his son, and never picks a fight if he doesn't have to.
There is one very violent scene where the main character fights a dragon. However, players only fight the dragon to protect one of their friends in-game.
As for the actual quality of the game, this game is amazing and a must play if you can stomach some swearing and violence.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","God of War is easily my and my son’s favourite game on the PlayStation 4. Graphically it is incredible, story and gameplay equally as good.
VIOLENCE: 8/10 Blood and gore, the most violent taking down a huge dragon with red blood and leaving a gaping hole in its face. Blood and gore is infrequent though, most violence is acted upon monsters, with non-red blood or no blood at all, however it does involve dismemberment of aforementioned monsters, but them being monsters and with the aforementioned blood description, it all looks very cartoony.
LANGUAGE: 7/10 Infrequent bad language but the word f**k is probably the most used across the game.
SEX: 3/10 One reference to it where the word f**k is used in a sexual context.
THERE ARE NO OTHER FORMS OF INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT",""

"God of War (2018)","age 17+","(MINOR SPOILERS) This is a fantastic game, and if you can, play it immediately. This is probably up there in my top ten games ever. So without further ado, let's jump into it!
Violence: Yes, just like the old games, it is very gory, but not unnecessary, as it has its purpose. Spoiler free examples include: Ripping a draugr's body in half (the blood is yellow), chopping up enemies with your axe, and beating people to near death.
Language: The language is very infrequent but includes: ""S--t"", ""C--k"", ""Ass"", and ""F--k"".
Drinking/Smoking: The only reason I include this is because a brief scene were Kratos (the protagonist) gives his son a jug of alcohol from Greece, to which the son spits out. Very heartwarming scene.
Overall: Fantastic game, I recommend to anyone.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","Uhh yeah this game contains violence, but its not realistic at all... its more like cartoon violence, the atmosphere gives you a feeling of platform game for teens/adults, i would imagine the main audience for this is boys age of 12 to 19. There is a lot of battling and slashing and ripping your enemies, but it is not done in realistic manner at all... Only few enemies you fight resemble human.
The story is way overrated thought, its just mythology turned upside down, nordic/germanic gods are turned to villains and nordic/germanic villains are turned to good guys ( For example in this game the Aesir god Thor and Baldr are ""bad"" and the giant serpent Jordmungadr is ""good"" ) so basically it just gives your kids a twisted history lesson, kind of if you made a christian game and made Jesus the villain.
Oh and there is quite a bit of swearing, done by a specific dwarf ""Brock""
All in all, nothing that a 14 year old kid couldn't handle, they have seen A LOT worse in movies. I would rate it even lower, but i think it gives you wrong idea of nordic mythology, so i think you should be 14 to understand that it is just a game and not a lesson in nordic mythologies :)",""

"God of War (2018)","age 17+","The game does have killing but NEVER humans just monsters. As a die hard god of war lover, I can tell u this is good for ages 13+ because its not super violent as the other god of war games where all u do is kill people for vengeance and have sex with women for points. in this game (the latest god of war) there is no sex AT ALL, its not about killing people for hate, just monsters in order to finish kratos duty as a father to mentor his son into not being like his old self, and that's really it. The kills for monsters are NOT gory as people think, there is rarely any gore shown when u kill monsters and even when u do, its not extreme at all, its mild gore tv-ma level, this is nowhere near mortal kombat or bloodborne gore. There is no ripping hearts and heads off, u just kill monsters/creatures with axes and arrows. The game doesn't teach about war its just a father and son bonding moment for kratos with his kid.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","for all ages, fantastic game with a different but still fantastic story line.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","I was worried that this game would be sex infested such as other games like GTA which I would never let my son go near. However after my son persuaded me to buy this game for him I watched very closely and soon found out that there was no sex or anything vulgar scenes. Rather, the only reason this game is an 18 is purely down to two reasons. Firstly there is a lot of use of the ""f"" word and ""sh*t"" which are the only two vulgar words he used and next the violence. In the game he battles monsters and gods who do not resemble humans in any way to protect his son. He kills them with axes and with his fists in meelee combat and there is blood. However there is no more blood than would be in the game Bloodborne for example which is a 16. I understand that at some stage this game was originally a 16 but had moved to an 18 due to the repeated swearing which as a parent can accept that my children have sworn many times. Overall I think this game really is suitable from age 14 up and finally quick mention, you can turn the blood off in the settings.",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","I lbought this game for my two sons (12 and 14). One of them asked me for it as a birthday gift and I hoped that this would be a appropriate game.

I recognized only little language (barely any at all) but, violence was a key factor. There wasn’t to bad of violence though because the blood was colored blue and orange which really changed things up. The main character though is really just fighting to protect his son that he really loved and your really on killing made up creatures.

"God of War (2018)","age 17+","God of war 4 is a really good game,there isn't that much gore and little to no swearing,the game can be difficult at times but for the majority its fairly easy.Its really nice to watch the relationship between Kratos and atreus grow over time as well",""
"God of War (2018)","age 17+","I typically wait until the end of the story and ask myself, “what did I learn?”. Never have I needed to think carefully from the very beginning of a story and think how this applies to me.
Yes, the combat is fluid and epic, with a need for careful planning on how to approach battles, but more importantly, for me, is the relationship between father and son.
Although I don’t agree with some of the ways Kratos (the main character) teaches his son, I can appreciate that he’s trying really hard.

"Battlefield 2042","age 15+","Battlefield 2042 (2021) follows a futuristic war on a verity of different vast landscapes, and throughout expect lots of shooting but little blood.
VIOLENCE: MILD
Throughout gameplay, expect constant gunfire and explosions with no injury detail and nearly unnoticeable, small spurts of blood worthy of a T rating. Players can use a wide arsenal of weapons such as pistol, shotguns, assault rifles, snipers and rocket launchers to take down enemies and capture points on the map. Like I said, killing soldiers results in a spray of blood, but this is rarely noticeable due to the amount of action happening onscreen.
The most violent feature in the game is takedowns, doing these results in the enemy getting stabbed in the chest, stomach and rarely the throat, one of them depicts the enemies throat getting slit. These are all very brief and non-graphic as none show any injury detail but just small spurts of blood.
This game possesses the mildest violence in the recent M rated Battlefield series, as none of the violence is that bloody and none of it contains any amount of detail, making the violence section mostly T rated.
LANGUAGE: MODERATE
During battles, soldiers will yell out words such as “f*ck”, “motherf*cker” and “sh*t” infrequently, and a lot of this language is hard to hear due to a he sound of gunfire and explosions.
Although the language is infrequent and appears uncommonly, turning off the volume of the game does not effect gameplay as there is no story or campaign.

"Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut","age 16+","First off, the game itself is very historical and has GREAT role modles, putting you in the shoes of a samurai, and the whole point of the game is to stop your enemys from taking over a place called Tsushima. Sure the game has some blood but no gore at all. I found a way in the settings to dissable most of the blood anyway if you dont want your child seeing blood. No nudity, maybe some swearing but nothing TO bad. Overall, this is a great game, and tweens should be able to play it. Thank you for taking your time to read this review.",""
"Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut","age 16+","Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best PlayStation exclusive titles that I have ever played. First off, the game just looks gorgeous. It's one of the very few games that I've just been blown away by how pretty it is. And to top that off, the photo mode is simply incredible - it goes into so much detail and is honestly the best I've seen in any video game, period. Everything, from the trees, to the grass, to the animals, even the blood on Jin's sword, is so realistic and stunning. Now I'm going to talk about the gameplay. At first, learning how to perfectly parry and dodge enemies is very hard, but as time goes on performing these moves successfully gets more familiar and thus easier. This isn't a game where you can just mash random buttons and hope for the best; combat requires technique, precision and split-second timing. You may not like this as it isn't exactly casual, but personally I find it to be enjoyable. Speaking of technique, one really cool feature of Ghost of Tsushima is the ability to switch between different fighting stances. Different stances perform best against different enemies, so you have to be constantly changing stance depending on who is attacking you. I personally find this quite fun, as it provides a challenge. Exploration is great; it's an open-world, full of wildlife and flowers to observe and collect, and (as mentioned earlier) the scenery is simply breathtaking. Anyway, let's move on. Skill progression is done pretty well, it's presented in a sort-of table that's divided into different categories that make navigating and choosing abilities easier, depending on what you're really looking for (stealth, combat, etc.). Loading times are pretty quick which isn't ever a bad thing, the music is really scenic and cool, the characters (especially Jin) are interesting as you get to see them develop throughout the story, and the plot is fairly simple yet intriguing. There are also plenty of side-missions to distract you and keep the fun going once the main story has been completed. Throughout my play-through, I have encountered some minor bugs and glitches, but nothing game-breaking and nothing that ruins the experience. If you like to be immersed in your games then these may irritate you, but they aren’t frequent and they mostly fix themselves after a few seconds. Also, switching between different weapons can be confusing. In order to switch to explosive arrows, for example, you have to press L2, then right on the D-pad, then triangle. These combinations can be hard to remember and you may find yourself struggling in battle, attempting to recall how to equip the different throwables and types of arrow (I know I have). Overall, Ghost of Tsushima is an excellent game with only a few small flaws. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a PlayStation 4 or 5, because trust me, you do not want to miss out on this masterpiece. 9.3/10.",""
"Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut","age 16+","This games takes my breath away everyime I play. Beautiful scenery with a great combat system is the perfect pair. The developers really outdid themselves and have nailed this game down to the smallest details. It's moderately violent, death is part of the game though, yet it is in no way excessive and the blood can be turned off. I don't usually write reviews but this game definitely deserves one. On point.",""

"","","","First off, the game itself is very historical and has GREAT role modles, putting you in the shoes of a samurai, and the whole point of the game is to stop your enemys from taking over a place called Tsushima. Sure the game has some blood but no gore at all. I found a way in the settings to dissable most of the blood anyway if you dont want your child seeing blood. No nudity, maybe some swearing but nothing TO bad. Overall, this is a great game, and tweens should be able to play it. Thank you for taking your time to read this review."
"","","","Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best PlayStation exclusive titles that I have ever played. First off, the game just looks gorgeous. It's one of the very few games that I've just been blown away by how pretty it is. And to top that off, the photo mode is simply incredible - it goes into so much detail and is honestly the best I've seen in any video game, period. Everything, from the trees, to the grass, to the animals, even the blood on Jin's sword, is so realistic and stunning. Now I'm going to talk about the gameplay. At first, learning how to perfectly parry and dodge enemies is very hard, but as time goes on performing these moves successfully gets more familiar and thus easier. This isn't a game where you can just mash random buttons and hope for the best; combat requires technique, precision and split-second timing. You may not like this as it isn't exactly casual, but personally I find it to be enjoyable. Speaking of technique, one really cool feature of Ghost of Tsushima is the ability to switch between different fighting stances. Different stances perform best against different enemies, so you have to be constantly changing stance depending on who is attacking you. I personally find this quite fun, as it provides a challenge. Exploration is great; it's an open-world, full of wildlife and flowers to observe and collect, and (as mentioned earlier) the scenery is simply breathtaking. Anyway, let's move on. Skill progression is done pretty well, it's presented in a sort-of table that's divided into different categories that make navigating and choosing abilities easier, depending on what you're really looking for (stealth, combat, etc.). Loading times are pretty quick which isn't ever a bad thing, the music is really scenic and cool, the characters (especially Jin) are interesting as you get to see them develop throughout the story, and the plot is fairly simple yet intriguing. There are also plenty of side-missions to distract you and keep the fun going once the main story has been completed. Throughout my play-through, I have encountered some minor bugs and glitches, but nothing game-breaking and nothing that ruins the experience. If you like to be immersed in your games then these may irritate you, but they aren’t frequent and they mostly fix themselves after a few seconds. Also, switching between different weapons can be confusing. In order to switch to explosive arrows, for example, you have to press L2, then right on the D-pad, then triangle. These combinations can be hard to remember and you may find yourself struggling in battle, attempting to recall how to equip the different throwables and types of arrow (I know I have). Overall, Ghost of Tsushima is an excellent game with only a few small flaws. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a PlayStation 4 or 5, because trust me, you do not want to miss out on this masterpiece. 9.3/10."
"","","","This games takes my breath away everyime I play. Beautiful scenery with a great combat system is the perfect pair. The developers really outdid themselves and have nailed this game down to the smallest details. It's moderately violent, death is part of the game though, yet it is in no way excessive and the blood can be turned off. I don't usually write reviews but this game definitely deserves one. On point."
"","","","Amazing game.Sucker Punch started the ps4 era and ended it with a swan song with ghost of tsushima. A captivating and heartfelt story.The gameplay is filled with so many abilities and the skill tree is just fascinating with three modes.The emotional beats connecting jin to his allies and his uncle. The mongols invasion of the island offers a breath of fresh air to the open world genre.The mythical quest are so much fun and helps to deepen the lore of the game.Chasing foxes to their dens.The graphics are just plain amazing especially playing on the old generation.The particles are just amazing from dense flower fields to the burning towns you can see the amazing parties details.The amount of flower and leave details is simply stunning.

Throughout the game, your character ensures several forms of torture viewed from a first person perspective. These include the protagonist getting his hand and fingers bitten in half, getting his hand cut on barbed wire, getting his wrists and hands bitten repeatedly by werewolves, getting suspended on hooks stabbed in his hands and then torn off, getting his entire hand sliced clean off and then put back on, getting mauled on the stomach by a massive werewolf, getting his head smashed against the floor, getting hurled around, getting his heart ripped out and crushed along with death animations showing him getting eaten, impaled, crushed or obliterated. Note that this makes up the most graphic violence in the game and is shown from a first person perspective, so it is much less graphic than it sounds. Despite this, blood is still shown most of the time.
Several people are killed in a house, but detail is limited.
In combat, you face mystical creatures and monsters including dragons, creatures, werewolves, robots and zombies. When targeting the heads of zombies or werewolves they can be shot off showing blood.
You stab a monster woman in the chest, but she turns into a dragon before it kills her.
At a certain point you must swim in a basement filled with blood and zombies.
A large, disturbing fetus/baby chases after you for a tiny portion of the game.
Overall, the violence is quite tame for an M rated game, due to most of the violence being obscured by the first person view.

Now obviously this game isn't for children, and I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone under the age of 16. There are several scenes in which you (Ethan Winters) is dismembered and butchered. Several scenes depict you losing your limbs in incredibly gory detail. Other characters are brutally murdered (set on fire, dismembered, eaten etc...). The swearing is the usual f*ck, sh*t, and b*tch that you would expect from an 18+ game.
The game is pretty scary, especially for younger gamers who play the game, but overall the game feels less terrifying than the crazy hillbilly Louisiana ranch you traverse in RE7 as the antagonists and monsters are more fantasy based. However, I would say it is the second scariest game in the franchise below its predecessor.

"Hitman III","age 18+","I have talked to other parents about this game. It seems quite controversial among them as the name is ""Hitman."" When they hear their children asking them for the game, they immediately say no. This is because of the games name. A small thing you need to understand about the game is that you don't actually play as a bad guy. You are an agent who is sent out by the government to stop criminals/undercover agents/hitmen from harming others, or gathering up to much info. You do this by solving various puzzles and using clues to find out who the perpetrator is. It is looked down upon to kill people in this loose enough points you have to restart. In fact, the main missions in the game don't even let you kill people. if your child has seen movies such as the James Bond films, they will be able to handle this game.
The reason this game is rated such high by common sense is because of the language, which is all in the cut scenes that you can skip. I do believe this game is very strongly a don't judge a book by the cover case. My children have been doing very well in school since I got them this game which should say something. Not only does this game have challenging mathematical puzzles, but it helps you which real life skills. I walked in on my 11 year old son playing this while using algebra to help him solve a puzzle. I urge you to buy this game for your child.

"Hitman III","age 18+","I love it I let my kid play and he loved it. He’s about 11 and though it would be fine for others that are even ten. I watched over him playing it when he first got it and I honestly was hooked as well. It’s like James Bond if it was a game no nudity or things like that. Just fun action packed adventures for the whole family",""
"Hitman III","age 18+","Just a quick heads-up before the review: at the time of writing this (28th Jan), CSM's Hitman 3 video review contains a pretty big spoiler, so watch at your own risk. Now the review:
Hitman 3 is, undoubtedly, the best of the series. Not many changes have been made to the gameplay from Hitman 2, but to be honest, I'm fine with that. Hitman 2 was pretty spot-on, there weren't many issues to fix. The changes that have been made, however, are great, the most notable of which is Agent 47's brand-new hacker-camera, which can hack electronic locks among other things (such as taking photos, duh). Now, let me talk about the locations. In short, they're absolutely amazing - easily the best of any Hitman game. My favourite one is the nightclub in Berlin, which is full of atmosphere. You know that scene in the nightclub in John Wick? It's like that, but better. Another thing I like about Hitman 3 is that it's way more story-driven than the previous two. 2016's Hitman had a very basic story that felt more like an excuse to string together the assassinations than anything else, Hitman 2's story was more complicated (with several awesome twists!) but still felt a little forced, however Hitman 3 delivers an absolutely brilliant story. I was actually engaged in the cutscenes for once! If you felt that the previous two games were somewhat limp in that department, you don't have to concern yourself with that about Hitman 3. Now let's talk about the mission stories. In the previous games that were quite a few mission stories, maybe six or seven per mission? In Hitman 3 it's a bit different. Most locations have only three, but some have none at all (such as the final mission. I won't tell you why though, because that would be a spoiler!). However, I personally think that they're actually better than the ones in the first two. Take the one at Thornbridge Manor, for example, where you pose as a detective and solve a murder, before actually committing one yourself. That mission story was super detailed, and probably lasted me a good forty minutes, as opposed to the usual twenty. Quality over quantity, you know? I'm not saying the mission stories in Hitman 1 and 2 were bad, I'm just saying that these ones are better. Well, most of them, anyway (I'm looking at you, Mendoza). Speaking of, you can actually play both those games within Hitman 3, with all the graphical upgrades and gameplay changes, if you've purchased them and downloaded the legacy packs, which is great. There's also the added VR mode, but it's honestly not that good. It doesn't support the PlayStation Move controllers, so you aren't really playing Hitman in VR as much as you're playing Hitman with a VR headset on, if you get what I mean. It’s also pretty glitchy, nowhere near as clean as what was shown during the gameplay demo a few months back. If you have PSVR and want to give it a go, I'd highly recommend playing all the missions normally before doing them in VR, because that's the best way to experience them. It has potential, but it needs a lot of improvement. Another awesome thing about this game is the soundtrack - it's brilliant, way better than the other games, and it creates a ton of atmosphere. Lastly, there are plenty of escalation contracts to do once you've finished the main story, not to mention that the main story missions are very replayable anyway, so don't worry about Hitman 3 being too short for the full price (it's not). So to conclude, Hitman 3 is an amazing game. If you enjoyed the first two, then you'll absolutely love this one. The only downside is that, like the last two games, you can't complete challenges or earn XP while offline, which completely sucks, because it means you can't unlock any new weapons, gadgets or suits, and you're stuck with the default loadout for the whole game. Oh, and also you don't get many escalation missions with just the standard edition, but to be honest it's not such a big deal seeing how much else there is to do. But besides that, Hitman 3 is an absolute blast. 9.2/10.",""
"Hitman III","age 18+","Hitman 3 is the finale of the world of assasination trilogy and it knocks it out of the park (with the exception of one certain epilogue that will go nameless that stupidly took up a spot in the 6 map lineup). It’s a great game. Now, when you hear a title like hitman 3, I’m sure it sets off some red flags in your head, but this title is kinda misleading. Now don’t get me wrong, it is a game about killing, but it’s not your standard call of duty shooter, in fact it isn’t a shooter at all, it’s a puzzle game. In the game you play as an agent of a top secret organization called the ICA, the ICA’s job is to dispatch of people on behalf of clients, now, you don’t go killing random people, you’re strictly killing bad guy’s, over the top bond like bad guy’s (now keep this comparison to the bond franchise in mind, I’ll bring it up later). You play as the iconic character agent 47 (red tie and all), you work with your handler Diana Burnwoord to kill these over the top villainy villians, untill… well… I don’t want to spoil the game for you… Anyway, you travel to exotic international locations to kill your targets, you go to places like a giant gold tower above the clouds in dubai, the rainy neon streets of China where you’ll find some shady business dealings going on, a seedy busting nightclub in Berlin, or a wine vineyard in Argentina, and much much more, these locations are gorgeous, they are these big detailed open maps that you are let into to dispatch of your targets as creatively as possible. These maps also have some really cool concepts attached to them, for example, you travel to a manor on the English countryside where a murder has taken place (not by you), your job in this map is to solve the murder and to find your target, this mission is really cool and creative. In this game you have to use your brain to dispatch of your targets, you can’t just run up to your target and shoot him/her/they, if you do that you’ll immediately get gunned down by guards, you die real quick in this game, instead you have to plot your own perfect crime, you have to peice together enviormental details, npc conversations, different npc schedules, all sorts of stuff, when people say this game has educational value that’s what they’re talking about, this game really requires you to think. Now, lets get to what your here for.
Let’s talk about the rating of this game, it is rated M for blood, language, and substances. •The blood/Violence. The blood is very tame, almost non existent, you actively have to go out of your way to look for it, plus, this game is special, where you are heavily punished for killing non targets (I know you saw in the trailer common sense listed on the page, that the character was going around shooting people, this is very misleading), you loose points for killing non targets, these points are used to unlock new weapons, starting locations, outfits, and tools, loosing points is frustrating, trust me. The violence in this game is also pretty tame, kills in this game aren’t as gruesome as you might think, in fact they are usually really silly, for example, in the dubai map, you can dispatch of a target who is about to go skydiving by tampering with his parachute, you can already tell how its gonna go, it’s all topped of by a cheesy one liner by the straight faced agent 47. Most of the kills in this game are like this, largely bloodless and silly. Another thing to note is how darkly hilarious this game is, some of these kills man, this game has an amazing silly sense of dark humor.
• For the language, it is very far and in between, in fact it’s almost non existent, I only heard one F-bomb in the entire game, in a game with nearly 25 hours worth of gameplay content, think about it. Pg-13 movies are allowed to say 2 F bombs, I only heard one in my total of 30 hours playing the game (yes I know, that’s alot, I have alot of time on my hands when the kids are busy). Now, I did hear some sh-ts and some hells, but as stated before, Pg-13 movies can say and do alot worse, for example, the Marvel movies have sh-ts and hells galore.
•For substances, it’s all social drinking, Npc’s in crowds will be slowly sipping a glass of wine, no one is getting drunk or going crazy, it’s really quite tame.
Conclusion, if this game were a movie it would be pg-13, the only reason this game is rated M is for the language, and even that is basically non existent (except for the one F-bomb I heard). It’s very comparable to the Danial Creig Bond movies, if your kids can watch those movies, they can easily play this game. Dont listen to commen sense media’s review, their ratings tend to be very over exaggerated and conservative. Plus this game has some good educational value. I hope this review helped you make your decision. Have a great rest of your day, thank you.",""

A small thing you need to understand about the game is that you don't actually play as a bad guy. You are an agent who is sent out by the government to stop criminals/undercover agents/hitmen from harming others, or gathering up to much info. You do this by solving various puzzles and using clues to find out who the perpetrator is. It is looked down upon to kill people in this loose enough points you have to restart. In fact, the main missions in the game don't even let you kill people. if your child has seen movies such as the James Bond films, they will be able to handle this game.
The reason this game is rated such high by common sense is because of the language, which is all in the cut scenes that you can skip. I do believe this game is very strongly a don't judge a book by the cover case. My children have been doing very well in school since I got them this game which should say something. Not only does this game have challenging mathematical puzzles, but it helps you which real life skills. I walked in on my 11 year old son playing this while using algebra to help him solve a puzzle. I urge you to buy this game for your child.
Sorry of this English is bad as i am using a google translate"
"","","","I love it I let my kid play and he loved it. He’s about 11 and though it would be fine for others that are even ten. I watched over him playing it when he first got it and I honestly was hooked as well. It’s like James Bond if it was a game no nudity or things like that. Just fun action packed adventures for the whole family"
"","","","Just a quick heads-up before the review: at the time of writing this (28th Jan), CSM's Hitman 3 video review contains a pretty big spoiler, so watch at your own risk. Now the review:
Hitman 3 is, undoubtedly, the best of the series. Not many changes have been made to the gameplay from Hitman 2, but to be honest, I'm fine with that. Hitman 2 was pretty spot-on, there weren't many issues to fix. The changes that have been made, however, are great, the most notable of which is Agent 47's brand-new hacker-camera, which can hack electronic locks among other things (such as taking photos, duh). Now, let me talk about the locations. In short, they're absolutely amazing - easily the best of any Hitman game. My favourite one is the nightclub in Berlin, which is full of atmosphere. You know that scene in the nightclub in John Wick? It's like that, but better. Another thing I like about Hitman 3 is that it's way more story-driven than the previous two. 2016's Hitman had a very basic story that felt more like an excuse to string together the assassinations than anything else, Hitman 2's story was more complicated (with several awesome twists!) but still felt a little forced, however Hitman 3 delivers an absolutely brilliant story. I was actually engaged in the cutscenes for once! If you felt that the previous two games were somewhat limp in that department, you don't have to concern yourself with that about Hitman 3. Now let's talk about the mission stories. In the previous games that were quite a few mission stories, maybe six or seven per mission? In Hitman 3 it's a bit different. Most locations have only three, but some have none at all (such as the final mission. I won't tell you why though, because that would be a spoiler!). However, I personally think that they're actually better than the ones in the first two. Take the one at Thornbridge Manor, for example, where you pose as a detective and solve a murder, before actually committing one yourself. That mission story was super detailed, and probably lasted me a good forty minutes, as opposed to the usual twenty. Quality over quantity, you know? I'm not saying the mission stories in Hitman 1 and 2 were bad, I'm just saying that these ones are better. Well, most of them, anyway (I'm looking at you, Mendoza). Speaking of, you can actually play both those games within Hitman 3, with all the graphical upgrades and gameplay changes, if you've purchased them and downloaded the legacy packs, which is great. There's also the added VR mode, but it's honestly not that good. It doesn't support the PlayStation Move controllers, so you aren't really playing Hitman in VR as much as you're playing Hitman with a VR headset on, if you get what I mean. It’s also pretty glitchy, nowhere near as clean as what was shown during the gameplay demo a few months back. If you have PSVR and want to give it a go, I'd highly recommend playing all the missions normally before doing them in VR, because that's the best way to experience them. It has potential, but it needs a lot of improvement. Another awesome thing about this game is the soundtrack - it's brilliant, way better than the other games, and it creates a ton of atmosphere. Lastly, there are plenty of escalation contracts to do once you've finished the main story, not to mention that the main story missions are very replayable anyway, so don't worry about Hitman 3 being too short for the full price (it's not). So to conclude, Hitman 3 is an amazing game. If you enjoyed the first two, then you'll absolutely love this one. The only downside is that, like the last two games, you can't complete challenges or earn XP while offline, which completely sucks, because it means you can't unlock any new weapons, gadgets or suits, and you're stuck with the default loadout for the whole game. Oh, and also you don't get many escalation missions with just the standard edition, but to be honest it's not such a big deal seeing how much else there is to do. But besides that, Hitman 3 is an absolute blast. 9.2/10."
"","","","Hitman 3 is the finale of the world of assasination trilogy and it knocks it out of the park (with the exception of one certain epilogue that will go nameless that stupidly took up a spot in the 6 map lineup). It’s a great game. Now, when you hear a title like hitman 3, I’m sure it sets off some red flags in your head, but this title is kinda misleading. Now don’t get me wrong, it is a game about killing, but it’s not your standard call of duty shooter, in fact it isn’t a shooter at all, it’s a puzzle game. In the game you play as an agent of a top secret organization called the ICA, the ICA’s job is to dispatch of people on behalf of clients, now, you don’t go killing random people, you’re strictly killing bad guy’s, over the top bond like bad guy’s (now keep this comparison to the bond franchise in mind, I’ll bring it up later). You play as the iconic character agent 47 (red tie and all), you work with your handler Diana Burnwoord to kill these over the top villainy villians, untill… well… I don’t want to spoil the game for you… Anyway, you travel to exotic international locations to kill your targets, you go to places like a giant gold tower above the clouds in dubai, the rainy neon streets of China where you’ll find some shady business dealings going on, a seedy busting nightclub in Berlin, or a wine vineyard in Argentina, and much much more, these locations are gorgeous, they are these big detailed open maps that you are let into to dispatch of your targets as creatively as possible. These maps also have some really cool concepts attached to them, for example, you travel to a manor on the English countryside where a murder has taken place (not by you), your job in this map is to solve the murder and to find your target, this mission is really cool and creative. In this game you have to use your brain to dispatch of your targets, you can’t just run up to your target and shoot him/her/they, if you do that you’ll immediately get gunned down by guards, you die real quick in this game, instead you have to plot your own perfect crime, you have to peice together enviormental details, npc conversations, different npc schedules, all sorts of stuff, when people say this game has educational value that’s what they’re talking about, this game really requires you to think. Now, lets get to what your here for.
Let’s talk about the rating of this game, it is rated M for blood, language, and substances. •The blood/Violence. The blood is very tame, almost non existent, you actively have to go out of your way to look for it, plus, this game is special, where you are heavily punished for killing non targets (I know you saw in the trailer common sense listed on the page, that the character was going around shooting people, this is very misleading), you loose points for killing non targets, these points are used to unlock new weapons, starting locations, outfits, and tools, loosing points is frustrating, trust me. The violence in this game is also pretty tame, kills in this game aren’t as gruesome as you might think, in fact they are usually really silly, for example, in the dubai map, you can dispatch of a target who is about to go skydiving by tampering with his parachute, you can already tell how its gonna go, it’s all topped of by a cheesy one liner by the straight faced agent 47. Most of the kills in this game are like this, largely bloodless and silly. Another thing to note is how darkly hilarious this game is, some of these kills man, this game has an amazing silly sense of dark humor.
• For the language, it is very far and in between, in fact it’s almost non existent, I only heard one F-bomb in the entire game, in a game with nearly 25 hours worth of gameplay content, think about it. Pg-13 movies are allowed to say 2 F bombs, I only heard one in my total of 30 hours playing the game (yes I know, that’s alot, I have alot of time on my hands when the kids are busy). Now, I did hear some sh-ts and some hells, but as stated before, Pg-13 movies can say and do alot worse, for example, the Marvel movies have sh-ts and hells galore.
•For substances, it’s all social drinking, Npc’s in crowds will be slowly sipping a glass of wine, no one is getting drunk or going crazy, it’s really quite tame.
Conclusion, if this game were a movie it would be pg-13, the only reason this game is rated M is for the language, and even that is basically non existent (except for the one F-bomb I heard). It’s very comparable to the Danial Creig Bond movies, if your kids can watch those movies, they can easily play this game. Dont listen to commen sense media’s review, their ratings tend to be very over exaggerated and conservative. Plus this game has some good educational value. I hope this review helped you make your decision. Have a great rest of your day, thank you."
"","","","This shouldn't be 18+. The blood, swearing and drugs hardly appear and in some cases non-egsistent"
"","","","The violence is very subtle and the blood does practically not exist, there is no gore and drugs do not effect the game in any way."
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","Parents need to know that this is by far the most mature M rated game that I have ever seen, heard of, or played. I will start out by talking about the language. Very frequent uses of f--k, s--t, b-tch, a--hole, and c--t. The amount of profanity isn't as much as GTA 5, but it still has much more profanity then most other games. Players can drink alcohol, get drunk, smoke, do illegal and legal drugs, and lots more. The violence in this game actually surprised me. I expected the gore to be like Doom or Left 4 Dead. The game usually isn't very gory, but at times it is. Combat with guns usually isn't that bloody, but using melee weapons like katanas is pretty graphic. Blood sprays, limbs and heads are hacked off, and people are eviscerated. Violence and language are not the most mature aspect of the game however. This game comes so close to an AO rating that I am surprised that it scored an M rating because of the sexual content. (AO means Adults Only. Most AO rated games are pornographic games. The AO rating is the equivilent for the NC-17 rating in movies.) M rated games are usually bad enough, but this one makes even the most sexual M rated games look like mario. The developers of this game obviously spent a long time making physics and animations for your private parts and sex scenes. When you are creating your character, you can chose the size of your breasts, butt, or penis. You can chose what your pubic hair or what your genitals look like. Later in the game, you can pay prostitutes to have sex with you. Female characters are often objectified, but unlike other games, their breasts and butts are not exaggerated. (usually) There are sex scenes later in the game as well and you can romance many characters. Sexual diologue is very common as well. I will say it again, this is by far the most sexual game I have ever played. (Keep in mind, I am a fan of the Witcher 3, which is another very sexual game which was made by the same creators of this game.) All of the mature content aside, this game does not live up to the hype and unrealistic expectations. This game is one of the most (if not THE most) hyped games of all time. The game does look great, provided you are not playing on a last gen console. (Ps4 or Xbox one) It also offers lots of choice and a pretty nice progression system. It even has a pretty good story with pretty good characters in my oppinion. It has WAY too many bugs though. Some are game breaking, like when you fall through the floor. Some are weird, like when people walk through solid objects or a person in a wheelchair gets up and runs away. Some of them are hillarious, like when your penis shows through your pants and you can't get rid of it. (Imagine having a serious conversation with a character and your exposed penis is poking out) I often dissagree with Common Sense Media's video game reviews. (Like how they rated Demon's Souls 18+ when it is easily 14+ in my oppinion) This review however, I wholeheartedly agree. If this game got some tweaking, like if the developers fixed the glitches and continually added to the game and made it feel more alive, it would be great. Parents, even with the ""filters"" on this game is NOT for kids AT ALL. Kids and teens, this game is not worth arguing with your parents about.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","Unlike other parents that use this website, I have played through the game and have enough knowledge to review it. First off this game has Nudity but that can be toggled off inside the menus. In the story there are gritty themes which may be hurtful to sensitive kids. This game should only be for kids who aren’t sensitive and are mature enough to play. If your child is mature and has been watching R movies or playing GTA or RDR2 I see them having no problem playing this game. There is optional sex which isn’t very hard to come by and a lot of swearing. If your child has a phone and has been exposed to the internet and friends, I believe he or she has seen a lot of this at least by the age of 14 behind your back. Kids are exposed to many problems on the internet and they themselves deal with it and move on. Kids are smarter then we give them credit for and I believe that this game is playable for 14 year olds at the lowest. This game is a very enjoyable experience for me and my son and will continue to give us lots of entertainment for the next month or so.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","It’s is a very good game that I feel alright letting my 12 year old play yes there is strong language but what comes from school is way worse there is nudity and it is blurred out sometimes and that is probably one of my only problems with the game.most of the other stuff is partly by choice like drinking drugs and smoking but they can be avoided a lot of the time. The goriness is violent and there is a lot of blood but a lot of the time this can be avoided too unless you happen to be in a story mode mission that requires you to eliminate people. But overall is is a good game that I feel comfortable letting my 12 year old play",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","It's pushing the m 17+",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","Even without the insulting amount of jank, which is exponentially worse on 8th gen consoles (to the point of complete unplayability), its an unremarkable game. Not terrible by design but far from what the sensory-overload driven hype train promised. It boils down to a glorified Call of Duty campaign that just happens to be in an open world; a beautiful but shallow and strangely lifeless world. Most of the cool features [car chases, spider bot, nightlife, braindance] are scripted events (if they havent been completely removed that is), skill trees are uninspired, police AI is almost non-existant, dialog is of little consequence, select few missions offer tactical freedom, side content is copy paste, verticality in nowhere near as prevalent as promised, customization is limited, the story is decent. At least the music is awesome and I cant say no to Keanu even when he is miscast. In the end we got the videogame equivalent of an obnoxious preteen who overcompensates with shock value to prove he deserves to sit with the highschoolers. The game is overflowing with sex, profanity, and violence but it offers options to tone down all 3.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","Parents, the violence is bad, but John wick style fighting with stabbing, shooting, slicing, exploding people and cyborgs. As for sex, there is full frontal female and male nudity, without a sexual context, and there is a way to turn off nudity. Think about this, at age 11, kids see sex Ed videos in class, with graphically detailed nude descriptions of bodies. And sex scenes are easily skipped. Drugs and alcohol are everywhere. Overall it is a great role playing game for mature audiences.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","Although this game is not perfect when it comes to performance, that doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyed for what it is. There's a huge catch to that: only adults can appreciate this game. This game is perhaps the worst I've seen since GTA 5 when it comes to adult content. There's too much of everything in this game that kids shouldn't be exposed to. There's constant limb dismemberment, ripping people's faces off, lots of blood, crime that goes unpunished, dead bodies everywhere, and watching people suffer and plead for their lives. The sex is also way too overboard. There's even an option to customize your character's genitals and you can see it in full glory, and you can even get in sexual acts with other characters that involves seeing your genitals. You can also use sex toys to kill people with if you choose. Language is also a huge turn off for me: There's uses of the f-word, c-word, and pretty much every other swear word imaginable, used in almost every sentence. There are also ways to intoxicate yourself from drugs and alcohol in the game. I can only give two stars for the content in this game that parents should be worried about, and there's a lot!",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","There is a lot of nudity, sex, swearing, drug use, drinking, violence etc. throughout the game. Which, I don't see a big deal for a mature teenager.
However; this is not just a GTA sandbox (because that's what a lot of teenagers seem to think it is), there are very heavy topics in this game such as; pedophilia, human-trafficking, torture, and sexual assault to name a few. There's also a theme of death on a much deeper level than the mindless killing often present in games.
Frankly I think that most teenagers would either skip through all the dialogue mindlessly and have it go completely over their heads, or find it rooted in their brains for a number of years.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","Saw gameplay for the game And it was too mature first I saw violence and gore Second sexual romance scenes with nudity but I give it age 17+ because it doesn’t have mature humor like GTA. Should be left to adults 17+ Also the swearing is constant to with f bombs and the c word",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","First of all I agree this game should be an 18 but I don’t think This game should be as looked down upon as it is, I purchased it for my son and he absolutely loved it he wouldn’t stop talking about it at the dinner table and also keanu reeves is in it which he also thought was really interesting. There is a lot of sex scenes i this game but it can be turned off in settings and that doesn’t affect gameplay it just won’t play the cut scene that there would be nudity in which I think is a thing more games should have put in. I also think this game is good because it really explores technology and if it is a good thing or if we should maybe lay off it for a while and not be sucked into it until you are a literal robot like in the game. Some parts of the game are set a strip club but it can be turned off in settings or you can just look away but even then it’s just holograms in bikinis so still not as bad as gta v. The violence is not as bad as in call of duty, there’s still some dismemberment but you would see this more often in cod games like mw 2019 or warzone. Overall, amazing game would HIGHLY recommend for anyone at the age between 13-18.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","The game for the most part is fixed meaning the bugs and glitches are mostly gone. Also most of the other reviews focus too heavily on the sexual content, most of it can be turned off in the settings. And if the player is old enough to play the game then they should be fine with the content in this game. Also the swearing is no worse than what you would hear at a high school. Also the violence is not that bad many people overreact to it, it is no worse than a call of duty game or the saving private Ryan movie. Also there is a minor amount of drugs that the player can use but it is optional and the player has the choice to drink or smoke. The npc characters use drugs and smoke but people smoke and drink all the time in the real world. The world is very large and has a lot going on at all times it can have a little lag when driving or fast traveling but that is only on older systems I have the game on my Xbox one and my series x and I also have it on pc so this review is based on facts. Honestly I give the game a solid 8.5/10 on how good it is while I give it a 7/10 on how mature the content is. Most of the content is no worse than most movies.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","If you want an in depth view on what age is probably fine to play cyberpunk, I'd recommend a video as it's not a simple easy answer.
I can tell you as a 20 year old man with no children at the moment. I would not be comfortable letting my kid play this game under the age of 15 or 16.
The main thing you'd probably hear about it as far as it's age rating is the sexual content. And it is their in full force. This is probably the most I've personally seen as far as sexual content in a console release.
Players can customize every part of their character, and I mean literally everything. Players can customize things including but not limited to:
- Gender Identity
- Genitalia
- Breasts
Players can view NPC's (computer characters) and themselves fully naked. Players can also hire prostitutes and engage in sexual relationships with other NPC's and view and participate in near pornographic cut-scenes.
The violence, drug use, and swearing isn't the worst I've heard.
For an older teenager there isn't much to worry about honestly, considering they most likely have seen more adult themes in other sources of media.
If you are a parent I would not only research the game before letting your younger teenagers play it, but actually play it yourself, and I don't say that about may games at all.",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","Ok, so, This game contains: Quite a lot of violence, Drugs, Sex, and quite a lot of swearing, The reason I think it is age 14 and up though is becuase, In school, kids swear all the time, and honestly most youtubers now days swear quite a bit too, So if your child watches any youtubers, they most likely hear swearing all the time, and as with the violence, eh, It's just blood, I don't really see how it's that bad, Like Loads of movies have violent scenes, as for the sex, Your child probably knows about it anyway, no point hiding it, kids get taught sex ed and see detailed models of naked men and women in sex ed at the age of like 10 or 11, overall, if your child is mature, then I think it's ok for them to play this game if their 14 and up",""
"Cyberpunk 2077","age 18+","This game is absolutely horrifying; however, it is definitely worth playing if you can avoid some parts. The language alone would make anybody's grandparents roll over in their grave. My reason for writing this review is to make people aware of a mission called “Dirty Biz” this mission requires you to recover a braindance of a preacher's son being murdered. (For those of you who don't know, a braindance is like a super intense version of VR.) And although you can't watch any braindance in the game (even ones you buy with titles like “Three Mouths One Desire”) at the desk where the braindance is found, there is a list with titles like “Child__Forced__Death” And numerous other rape/death related atrocities.
The game is fun, but I wish I didn't see that. While this mission is OPTIONAL, I know many people want to complete the whole game so I strongly advise against looking at the list.",""

"","","","There is a lot of nudity, sex, swearing, drug use, drinking, violence etc. throughout the game. Which, I don't see a big deal for a mature teenager.
However; this is not just a GTA sandbox (because that's what a lot of teenagers seem to think it is), there are very heavy topics in this game such as; pedophilia, human-trafficking, torture, and sexual assault to name a few. There's also a theme of death on a much deeper level than the mindless killing often present in games.
Frankly I think that most teenagers would either skip through all the dialogue mindlessly and have it go completely over their heads, or find it rooted in their brains for a number of years."
"","","","Saw gameplay for the game And it was too mature first I saw violence and gore Second sexual romance scenes with nudity but I give it age 17+ because it doesn’t have mature humor like GTA. Should be left to adults 17+ Also the swearing is constant to with f bombs and the c word"
"","","","First of all I agree this game should be an 18 but I don’t think This game should be as looked down upon as it is, I purchased it for my son and he absolutely loved it he wouldn’t stop talking about it at the dinner table and also keanu reeves is in it which he also thought was really interesting. There is a lot of sex scenes i this game but it can be turned off in settings and that doesn’t affect gameplay it just won’t play the cut scene that there would be nudity in which I think is a thing more games should have put in. I also think this game is good because it really explores technology and if it is a good thing or if we should maybe lay off it for a while and not be sucked into it until you are a literal robot like in the game. Some parts of the game are set a strip club but it can be turned off in settings or you can just look away but even then it’s just holograms in bikinis so still not as bad as gta v. The violence is not as bad as in call of duty, there’s still some dismemberment but you would see this more often in cod games like mw 2019 or warzone. Overall, amazing game would HIGHLY recommend for anyone at the age between 13-18."
"","","","The game for the most part is fixed meaning the bugs and glitches are mostly gone. Also most of the other reviews focus too heavily on the sexual content, most of it can be turned off in the settings. And if the player is old enough to play the game then they should be fine with the content in this game. Also the swearing is no worse than what you would hear at a high school. Also the violence is not that bad many people overreact to it, it is no worse than a call of duty game or the saving private Ryan movie. Also there is a minor amount of drugs that the player can use but it is optional and the player has the choice to drink or smoke. The npc characters use drugs and smoke but people smoke and drink all the time in the real world. The world is very large and has a lot going on at all times it can have a little lag when driving or fast traveling but that is only on older systems I have the game on my Xbox one and my series x and I also have it on pc so this review is based on facts. Honestly I give the game a solid 8.5/10 on how good it is while I give it a 7/10 on how mature the content is. Most of the content is no worse than most movies."
"","","","If you want an in depth view on what age is probably fine to play cyberpunk, I'd recommend a video as it's not a simple easy answer.
I can tell you as a 20 year old man with no children at the moment. I would not be comfortable letting my kid play this game under the age of 15 or 16.
The main thing you'd probably hear about it as far as it's age rating is the sexual content. And it is their in full force. This is probably the most I've personally seen as far as sexual content in a console release.
Players can customize every part of their character, and I mean literally everything. Players can customize things including but not limited to:
- Gender Identity
- Genitalia
- Breasts
Players can view NPC's (computer characters) and themselves fully naked. Players can also hire prostitutes and engage in sexual relationships with other NPC's and view and participate in near pornographic cut-scenes.
The violence, drug use, and swearing isn't the worst I've heard.
For an older teenager there isn't much to worry about honestly, considering they most likely have seen more adult themes in other sources of media.
If you are a parent I would not only research the game before letting your younger teenagers play it, but actually play it yourself, and I don't say that about may games at all."
"","","","Ok, so, This game contains: Quite a lot of violence, Drugs, Sex, and quite a lot of swearing, The reason I think it is age 14 and up though is becuase, In school, kids swear all the time, and honestly most youtubers now days swear quite a bit too, So if your child watches any youtubers, they most likely hear swearing all the time, and as with the violence, eh, It's just blood, I don't really see how it's that bad, Like Loads of movies have violent scenes, as for the sex, Your child probably knows about it anyway, no point hiding it, kids get taught sex ed and see detailed models of naked men and women in sex ed at the age of like 10 or 11, overall, if your child is mature, then I think it's ok for them to play this game if their 14 and up"
"","","","This game is absolutely horrifying; however, it is definitely worth playing if you can avoid some parts. The language alone would make anybody's grandparents roll over in their grave. My reason for writing this review is to make people aware of a mission called “Dirty Biz” this mission requires you to recover a braindance of a preacher's son being murdered. (For those of you who don't know, a braindance is like a super intense version of VR.) And although you can't watch any braindance in the game (even ones you buy with titles like “Three Mouths One Desire”) at the desk where the braindance is found, there is a list with titles like “Child__Forced__Death” And numerous other rape/death related atrocities.
The game is fun, but I wish I didn't see that. While this mission is OPTIONAL, I know many people want to complete the whole game so I strongly advise against looking at the list."

"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War","age 18+","Parents need to know that there are three different modes in this game: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. There isn't very much blood or gore except in the Zombies mode. Most people will play Call of Duty for the Multiplayer, which is a mode where you play against other players. This game has lots of explosive action and shooting. It is very intense, but not very bloody. The zombies mode is pretty scary and gory, but lots of fun. Working together with teammates is really necessary in order to win. Shooting zombies will always spray blood and when you shoot a zombie's head or limb it will get blasted off. The Campaign has occasional uses of F--k and Sh-t but it is not very often. There are some disturbing parts in the campaign, but not as much as the previous game. Sometimes you will stab people or choke them out, so this mode is more mature then the Multiplayer mode. Most teens can handle it. I would recommend the Multiplayer mode for age 13, Campaign for age 15, and zombies for age 16. Parents should also know that content such as the blood and cursing can be turned off in the settings.

Whenever my 14 year old son goes out with friends I always make sure he sends me his location and where he is and what he is doing. And I don’t allow him to go to big party’s where there could be any type of alcohol or anything. So when my 14 year old son came up to me and asked me for this game and he told me that it was a call of duty and it’s MA I typed it up and watched about 1 to 2 hours of gameplay of it and, it’s really not that bad. It’s actually one of the tamest call of duty’s there has ever been.

I did not let my child play the zombies though because if the extreme violence. Keep your child away from zombies until they are older. I would rate zombies 15 to 17 plus. In my opinion this game is a great investment for a family if there child is moving into the teenager phase beacause it will let them take out there anger on the game in the form of shooting enemies.

"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales","age 13+","This game is not a bit underrated. It has everything from web slinging to completing science tasks. Less violent than the first Spiderman, Marvels' Spider Man. The story follows African-American Miles Morales, and how he has to defend the city against criminals. His mentor, Peter Parker, leaves for a trip, leaving Miles to defend the city. This story represents great messages and great role models. It also has plenty of diverse characters. It is very easy to learn, and never goes out of style. Some people could say that the violence in this game is a bit much for younger players, but I think that it is just about right. The heroes get cuts and scrapes in their suits, but it never shows how. There is red around the screen when you are weak, but no blood. Some characters are shown injured, but no blood or gore.

"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales","age 13+","This game is brilliant, and if your child is 12+ and owns a PS4, they definitely need to buy it. It is an extremely popular game that is a sequel to the first Spider-Man game.
Violence - 8/10
There isn't as much violence in this game as in the first one, but there is definitely lots. Punching, kicking and slamming into walls results in goons or henchmen being injured or knocked out (no specific blood). Some villains carry guns and can shoot Spider-Man (there is some blood in these sequences but movement is so fast it is barely noticeable). Some scenes are violent and disturbing, such as the brother of a villain being blown up (only shows his body begin to disintegrate before explosion takes place). There is some shooting, stabbing and deaths of innocent civilians, and another scene involves main character being beaten mercilessly whilst being tied to a chair (he screams in pain each time). Miles' venom power adds to the ferocity of his Spider-Man abilities to kick ass, and this also revolves in a bridge being blown up (if mission fails, people die) and a building is set on fire. Aftermath of this is two main characters bloody and wounded, struggling to get up. Under 12 year olds may find content disturbing. Apart from these, Spider-Man must beat up bad guys to stop conspiracy plots in New York.
Language - 5/10. Lots of use of crap, a--hole, and one or two uses of s--t in dialogue throughout the game, but nothing an 11 or 12 year old can't handle.
Drugs - 1/10. In the open-world aspect of the game, Spider-Man must stop some ongoing drug deals, but only the powder is briefly shown (easy to miss) and there is no taking of these drugs in the game.
Sex - 0/10. References to characters being 'prepared' in case they meet someone cute, but no sex or major kissing scenes whatsoever.
Positive messages - 10/10. Miles is a new Spider-Man struggling with the weight of his responsibilities as well as his new powers. He is also trying to cope with the death of his father (see first Spider-Man game). Miles is a friendly kid who enjoys helping those in needs. This game explores the power of friendship, the need to protect your loved ones and the terror of watching them die. It wants us to be more like Miles - a kid who doesn't give up.
Awesome game definitely worth playing - competitor for game of the year!!",""
"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales","age 13+","This game is great, but suffers from a bunch of problems, that aren't MASSIVE, but are a bit annoying.

The story is far too short, so try to get it half price somewhere.

Sometimes, you can hear enemies talking to each other about smuggling drugs but no drugs are ever present in the game.

"","","","This game is not a bit underrated. It has everything from web slinging to completing science tasks. Less violent than the first Spiderman, Marvels' Spider Man. The story follows African-American Miles Morales, and how he has to defend the city against criminals. His mentor, Peter Parker, leaves for a trip, leaving Miles to defend the city. This story represents great messages and great role models. It also has plenty of diverse characters. It is very easy to learn, and never goes out of style. Some people could say that the violence in this game is a bit much for younger players, but I think that it is just about right. The heroes get cuts and scrapes in their suits, but it never shows how. There is red around the screen when you are weak, but no blood. Some characters are shown injured, but no blood or gore. On top of that, Miles helps anybody he can, and he is a hard worker. He will not stop when the job is not done. Most of all, he just wants to impress Peter Parker, and get a name for himself as Spiderman. I rate this game 5/5 and I think it appropriate for ten and up."

The most questionable songs here are BLACKPINK &amp; Selena Gomez's ""Ice Cream"" and Billie Eilish's ""all the good girls to go to hell"". While young children may not pick up that ""Ice Cream"" isn't about actual ice cream, it will come pretty obvious to anyone older: ""You can take a lick but it's too cold to bite me...You're the cherry piece, so stay on top of me, so...Like it, love it, lick it, do it like la-la-la, oh yeah."" ""all the good girls go to hell"", while technically using the word in a religious sense, has a title alone that will be eyebrow-raising to conservative/religious parents.
While written out here this might all sound like a boatload of objectionable content, this all ultimately adds up to a handful of lines in songs that are more censored than they are on the radio, which is why I have kept CSM's 10+ recommendation.

"","","","While it is true that there is slight nudity decapitation and spurts of blood you can easily disable these features in settings at any time though i recommend that you do this straight away if you feel that you’re child cannot handle it."
"","","","Even though it has nudity blood and gore these can be disabled in the beginning ing settings
Enjoyed playing this with my 14 year old son"
"","","","I was shocked at the anti-Christian content in this game, and I've requested a refund. It is not possible to advance in the game without searching for and looting monasteries and killing everyone there, and several game characters make anti-Christian comments throughout. We stopped playing immediately after the first goal directed us to find and loot the first monastery. Completely unacceptable."
"","","","you can turn off the sex"
"","","","No offence, but it is pure garbage"
"","","","It has intense gory violence along with partial nudity, strong language and drugs and Alcohol not for young kids"
"","","","My 12 year old asked recently for this game. I wasn’t so comfier blue with an ‘M’ game at first because the hasn’t played very much violent games, but I thought he was mature enough, so I got it for him. Then, my 10 year old asked to play this. I said when I watch him play this for a few weeks. Then, I realized it’s an amazing game! If your kid has played Overwatch, they are definitely ready for this!"
"","","","This game may seem not to appropriate on the outside but when you dive into the game it is a jewel that I think all kids should learn about because Vikings are part of the world's ancient culture. There is some blood but if your kids watch Avengers then there is no problem. I think this is a great game and is appropriate for most Teens and pre-teens!!"
"","","","Assassin's Creed Valhalla is separate in the Assasin's Creed world. It is the first title in a new series. This particular game has a fair amount of blood but that can be turned off in settings. As far as scariness it is about a medium on a scale.
It has great music and is very realistic to what Vikings did back in the old days. There is singing, fighting to protect your territory from other Viking clans, and most importantly great scenery. Graphics are absolutely amazing and you completely control everything in the game. It's like a choose your own adventure book but in the Viking age. If you or your child has watched things like Avengers: Endgame or any of the Avengers movies Assassin's Creed: Valhalla will be OK. The only big thing is the scariness and that's pretty much it. I hope this will help you!"
"Watch Dogs: Legion","age 18+","I researched this game mainly because my child(aged 15 years) asked me to buy it. Since I researched the content in this game and I thought I would save some parents some time, and make a review on commonsensemedia.org. All of the inappropriate content is listed from the most severe, to the most minor.
Language: I saw the beginning of the game. The language was ridiculous! There wasn't one conversation clean enough for anyone to repeat! I researched thinking language like this was used throughout, and I was pleasantly surprised. The beginning was something called a scripted-cutscene. Language only occurs in a cutscene that everyone must see. Since the game gives you all the freedom to make your own choices and decisions, there are very little scripted-cutscenes, therefore making the language infrequent but very strong. I was still upset that the developers liberally put language throughout as it is easily my biggest pet-peeve. 4/5.
Violence: 50% of the time will be spent doing non-violent such as driving and recruiting people. The other 50% is violent activities. There are two types of violence, lethal and non-lethal. Non-lethal weapons are encouraged and the player will likely use non-lethal weapons most of the time. Sometimes use of lethal weapons is required. Even so when I watched my son play it, I was surprised to see no blood or gore. Based on the commonsensemedia.org review I expected the lethal-violence to be intense and bloody. Violence is mild and the only time lethal violence is required is in the beginning. The beginning is highest level violence you will ever see. I still thought the violence in some scripted-cutscenes had a slight spike in the average level of violence the player would see, but my statement of no gore and very little blood still stands. 3/5, max 4/5.
Drinking/Smoking: Some characters smoke and there are references to drugs and Marijuana. Your character doesn't take part in these but they are relatively frequent. 3/5(no more no less)
Sex:(Not an issue for anyone above the age of 12) I will not talk about this in detail because it may not be appropriate for children reading this. I My son is already 2 hours in and I didn't see a single sexual reference. I researched and found that human trafficking is mentioned and I watched the scene of which it was mentioned. It is likely your child won't know it is until he becomes an adult. Even so the reference is very mild and some player may not come across it because as I stated earlier the player makes their own choices and decisions.Sex is 1/5(no more no less)
Overall this a very mature game with mature themes. While I thought that no section crossed 4/5, the theme of the entire story is very disturbing because it talks about violent activism throughout. I feel that it paints a dark and disturbing picture unlike the vibrant watch dogs 2. The only positive I found in this game is, there are many puzzles throughout the combat and the player uses creativity throughout. Thank you and have great day!",""
"Watch Dogs: Legion","age 18+","It is very sad that most game companies aren't willing to make puzzle games without violent attributes. I will give the developers credit but at the end the day, all the children come for the action and the shooting. I thought this game was mild compared to other action games I have seen. Most of the violence is non-lethal which is a very nice addition. I was surprised to see lethal violence being represented without grotesque and bloody attributes. I didn't have a problem with the violence. The preposterous amounts of profanity used in the beginning gives the parent watching, a baleful experience. Surprisingly I didn't notice any profanity after that, making the language much more of a minuscule issue rather than a conspicuous one. I didn't notice any sex at all whatsoever. If sex is there, it is very unobtrusive. I noticed some smoking but it is a commonplace in our world, and it should be fine as long as your child knows smoking is not admissible action. I can see how this game is charming for teenagers and that precisely why I gave it a 4/5 stars. I felt the puzzles and creativity involved in this game made it sui generis. If your child is a fan of the mission impossible series, implore you to get this game for them. While it may seem vague, its fun and over-the-top action and puzzle solving feels so much like the movies series. You feel like Luther when hacking into servers and drones and you feel like Tom cruise when you are going into crazy car chases and driving. It feels like mission impossible and this game are a match made in heaven. Thank you for reading this review and I hope this helped you fellow parents! Have a great rest of your day!",""

"Mafia: Definitive Edition","age 18+","SEX/NUDITY - There is a brief moment of implied sex when a man and woman are heard making sexual moans from behind a door before they are interrupted. He is briefly shown on top of her, but without any nudity. There are also some references to a ""brothel"" and ""wh*re-house"", although nothing too explicit. There are instances of innuendo throughout. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are frequent sequences of strong bloody violence throughout, where your character must plough through enemies, killing them by beating them up, shooting them, or blowing them up with explosives. There is realistic bloody detail upon impact, including some blood spray. There are also some moments of more brutal violence depicted in cutscenes, including one scene where a man continuously stomps on a man's head until it has supposedly ""caved in"". A majority of this is off-screen, however the gory sound design makes it obvious what is happening behind the scenes. Some of the violence also results in bloody injury detail, such as bullet holes. PROFANITY - There is strong language (""f*ck""), as well as milder terms used throughout, although not excessively. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - Drinking and smoking are frequently depicted throughout, mainly in cutscenes. Drug misuse is mentioned occasionally, but is never shown nor endorsed by the game. THREAT/HORROR - There are frequent intense sequences of threat throughout gameplay, mainly involving shoot-outs and car chases.

DRUGS: (3/10) Drugs are spoken about, drug trafficking is a large part of the mafia's dealings. However, you never see the drugs, or see anyone taking them, they are just frequently mentioned.
IS IT GOOD: (8/10) Yes, this game is amazing, awesome storytelling and great graphics, surprisingly good gameplay even though the original is like, 18 years old. One scene has a race which may be rage inducing, but get over yourself."
"","","","SEX/NUDITY - There is a brief moment of implied sex when a man and woman are heard making sexual moans from behind a door before they are interrupted. He is briefly shown on top of her, but without any nudity. There are also some references to a ""brothel"" and ""wh*re-house"", although nothing too explicit. There are instances of innuendo throughout. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are frequent sequences of strong bloody violence throughout, where your character must plough through enemies, killing them by beating them up, shooting them, or blowing them up with explosives. There is realistic bloody detail upon impact, including some blood spray. There are also some moments of more brutal violence depicted in cutscenes, including one scene where a man continuously stomps on a man's head until it has supposedly ""caved in"". A majority of this is off-screen, however the gory sound design makes it obvious what is happening behind the scenes. Some of the violence also results in bloody injury detail, such as bullet holes. PROFANITY - There is strong language (""f*ck""), as well as milder terms used throughout, although not excessively. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - Drinking and smoking are frequently depicted throughout, mainly in cutscenes. Drug misuse is mentioned occasionally, but is never shown nor endorsed by the game. THREAT/HORROR - There are frequent intense sequences of threat throughout gameplay, mainly involving shoot-outs and car chases.
18 - Suitable only for persons aged 18 years and over. Contains very strong content, and is recommended for playing by adults only."

You use various weapons ranging from a pickax to a machete or a small pistol to a shotgun that can blow off limbs with the click of a button.

I loved the first game, and the characters, so to see them get butchered in this game is very saddening. Characters also make very stupid decisions. These decisions, some of the characters, and the buildup of the plot make the story very weak, stupid and pathetic. the only positive about this game is the graphics. But this game does have the worst game story ever created.
*SPOILERS*
So Joel, the amazing protagonist from the first game, the character we watched grow and evolve, along side Ellie, is killed in one of the most disrespectful ways possible, he is shot with a shotgun and hit in the head with a gold club. Later Ellie finds Joel and is pinned down, abby bashes in Joel’s head in a few more times and then delivers the final blow with pieces of Joel’s brain on the floor. Imagine seeing that after finishing the first game.
there is also an extremely unnecessary sex scene between abby and owen. So there you go, Tlou 2 is a very pathetic, stupid game and I recommend you not to buy it.

It has extremely graphic violence, with both Elly and Abby kill with little or no remorse. In the end, Elly realizes that violence just leads to violence, and stops. Abby on the other hand does not.
Elly is a good girl with (sometimes) good intentions, but uses extreme violence to accomplish her goals. I think the game developers tried to make you like abby, but in my opinion failed. For better or worse, they seem like real flawed humans.
Some sex
Smoking and Marijuana.

"The Last of Us Part II","age 18+","Naughty Dog's The Last of Us: Part II is a feat of storytelling and artistic game design. An engaging story paired with thrilling gameplay and ""gore""geous graphics makes for a breathtaking playthrough. However, this story is not for children or young teens. On the surface, the level of graphic violence is not suitable for young eyes. During combat scenes, main characters stomp enemies' heads in, smash heads into walls, explode bodies (bloody limbs are shown flying), set people and ""zombies"" on fire, shoot and stab enemies (a testament to superb programming, when slashing an enemy with a knife, bloody gashes appear on the body). Enemies can be heard screaming, begging for mercy, yelling for help, etc. Players are also forced to kill dogs that attack them.
The plot itself is violence-centric. Our hero sets out on a revenge-fueled quest to hunt down and kill an entire group of people. Both main characters grapple with the murder of a loved one.
However, TLOU II uses this violence to both horrify and engage players. It questions where the line between humanity and monstrosity lies by using proximity to a literal perversion of humanity (the infected ""zombies""). It provokes an investigation into the validity of revenge plots and the dangers of cycles of violence. Dealing with heavy commentary on empathy, human evil, sickness, fear, and rage, the story also showcases diversity (including prominent LGBT characters and characters of color). This game is arguably one of the best ever written. Set in a lonely, dangerous world after the end of ours, The Last of Us: Part II dares to ask: After being corrupted by rage and consumed by violence, are we still ""us""? How evil do we have to be to lose our humanity? In a world overrun with infected monsters, how different are we from them, and how many of us are still the last of us?",""
"","","","Amazing game with beautiful graphics amazing gameplay and music. The story isn’t as good as the first but still very interesting and brilliant acting. The game contains high levels of violence but it’s not exaggerated like Mortal Kombat. The swearing is quite bad but nothing more you than what you would hear in middle school/secondary school. I think mature thirteen year olds and 14 year olds can play it and definitely 15 year olds."
"","","","As a person who is a big fan of the first game, I was extremely disappointed by the boring gameplay, repetitive story and awful new characters. The game tries to hard to be sad and then becomes hilarious. DONT BUY IT!!!"
"","","","Game is good monke has spoken. Game has very little sexual content. Game has language but it’s not that bad. Game is violent but 12 and up can handle it. Monke has spoken once again."
"","","","Good Game lmao"
"","","","This game is awesome. The story is terrific with so many great characters. The graphics are also awesome and everything about the game is great. What other parents need to know is that this game is pretty violent but not too bad, the language is there but it should be ok for children. And there isn’t really any sexual content in the game at all other than some references and nothing a 12 and up child couldn’t handle. Overall a brilliant must play game."
"","","","This is a great game, while it has gore, violence, and swearing, if your child is mature this game should be fine. Don’t listen to some of these reviews, the game is amazing and will be looked back on as an underrated masterpiece"
"","","","I am a PEGI age reviewer for games, and this game was so so disappointing. I was a huge fan of the first game. The violence sex and drugs and so on is terrible. The gameplay is okay and the story is terrible. Violence is 10/10, Language is (9.5/10), Sex(9/10), Drinking... is (8.5/10). Parents, this game definitely not for kids and kids, this game is not worth begging your parents for."
"","","","I think this game is amazing. Good graphics amazing acting it can be violent(Zombies etc). I think kids above 12 can play as a person who has played it I think it’s appropriate. Great game"
"","","","While not without its faults, this is still one of the most unique and incredible experiences I've had from a game. Relentlessly violent but is essential to the story.
A must have for any ps4 owner."
"","","","The last of us part 2 is an amazing game, some can argue the main plot is nowhere as good as the first but it still is a beautiful game. It takes place in a world riddled with infected or commonly known as “zombies” and you play as a young female on a quest for revenge. The violence in the game is stunning, and one of the only video games which has made me think once or twice about what I just did, every human you kill feels real and even has a name which can be heard by others screaming their name, even the dogs you kill don’t solely feel mindless, but actually feel like someone’s pet. You use various weapons ranging from a pickax to a machete or a small pistol to a shotgun that can blow off limbs with the click of a button. The game also has a graphic sex scene and also nudity scene around the dark world. There is some drug use but only scene shows it explicitly. Language can be heard at school and is nothing too bad"
"","","","This game is one of the best games I've ever played. There is some violence but nowhere near as bad as GTA or Call of Duty. And yes there is a couple sex scenes but nothing a 13 year old couldn't handle. The story , I will admit that it is not great but to be fair, most of the bad reviews are because people do not like how it mocks the first game's story but in my opinion its pretty good. There is some blood but as I said before nothing a 13 year old couldn't handle and it is nowhere near as bad as GTA or Call of Duty. The swearing is not so bad, nothing so bad as f*ck and most kids at this age who would play this game either hear the swearing at school or may even say it themselves. All in all, I personally love this game even though the story is a bit of a let down, its a great game."
"","","","A stunning, emotional, violent and very clever story. Can't shake it off after completing it. Story telling at this standard eclipses pretty much anything I've witnessed in any form. Subverts expectations on a level I'm never witnessed before, but makes you think and raises a mirror to the world we live in through an imagined one. However, characters are tortured and the violence is relentless. Also I found myself really on edge constantly due to pressures of the game, I honestly feel it can affect your anxiety barometer if played for long stretches. This is an adult game with adult themes, and I wouldn't recommend for under-aged kids."
"","","","Tlou 2 had the worst game plot ever to exist. There is no sense of closure, and players will leave mad, sad and unsatisfied. I loved the first game, and the characters, so to see them get butchered in this game is very saddening. Characters also make very stupid decisions. These decisions, some of the characters, and the buildup of the plot make the story very weak, stupid and pathetic. the only positive about this game is the graphics. But this game does have the worst game story ever created.
*SPOILERS*
So Joel, the amazing protagonist from the first game, the character we watched grow and evolve, along side Ellie, is killed in one of the most disrespectful ways possible, he is shot with a shotgun and hit in the head with a gold club. Later Ellie finds Joel and is pinned down, abby bashes in Joel’s head in a few more times and then delivers the final blow with pieces of Joel’s brain on the floor. Imagine seeing that after finishing the first game.
there is also an extremely unnecessary sex scene between abby and owen. So there you go, Tlou 2 is a very pathetic, stupid game and I recommend you not to buy it. But if you don’t really care about story and just like gameplay and graphics then go ahead and buy this game. The graphics and gameplay is very good."
"","","","Half the world thinks this is a masterpiece, while the other half thinks it is brutal and dull. I am not going to take a side, but instead i will go over the pros and cons, and let you decide for yourself.
It has extremely graphic violence, with both Elly and Abby kill with little or no remorse. In the end, Elly realizes that violence just leads to violence, and stops. Abby on the other hand does not.
Elly is a good girl with (sometimes) good intentions, but uses extreme violence to accomplish her goals. I think the game developers tried to make you like abby, but in my opinion failed. For better or worse, they seem like real flawed humans.
Some sex
Smoking and Marijuana.
Now it is up to you"
"","","","This game is honestly an example of an nc-17 rated game which means no children the reason for that is there is lots of characters who drink excessively there are couple characters who smoke too, there are also multiple scenes with graphic nudity and a sex scene by 2 characters included but can be skipped, swearing is just all over the game far worse than an average r rated movie and any call of duty games I would say at least a total of 300 uses of f**k and much more swearing mainly in cut scenes but however compared to the first game this game is around 23 hours long but still a lot of exceptionally foul language, and violence well let me just be honest do to how violent this game is just too much honestly just too much probably one of the most violent games ever made far more violent than the first overall this game isn’t for kids for all these reasons this is a very hard 18+ rated game."
"","","","First off if your child is sensitive to gore like large amounts don’t let them play this game has dismemberment face blowing off limbs etc
But this game story wise is amazing telling two main characters stories and having one on the side"
"","","","Naughty Dog's The Last of Us: Part II is a feat of storytelling and artistic game design. An engaging story paired with thrilling gameplay and ""gore""geous graphics makes for a breathtaking playthrough. However, this story is not for children or young teens. On the surface, the level of graphic violence is not suitable for young eyes. During combat scenes, main characters stomp enemies' heads in, smash heads into walls, explode bodies (bloody limbs are shown flying), set people and ""zombies"" on fire, shoot and stab enemies (a testament to superb programming, when slashing an enemy with a knife, bloody gashes appear on the body).

"Persona 4 Golden","age 15+","Love Persona 4 Golden and all the Persona and the Shin Megami Tensei games. The ""Not For Kids"" rating is completely unnecessary.

"Persona 4 Golden","age 15+","So, Common Sense has given this game a Not For Kids. I feel this is inappropriate - There's no bloody on-screen violence, what is there is offscreen and not shown, there's only mild language, and little to no sexual themes.
So, that said, why did they give it a Not For Kids? Well, it's not just being a bit too far on the safe side; they have reasons.
The primary suspect, I think, is that what little sexual and alcoholic reference there is involves a group of teenagers. None are 16 or 17 to my knowledge, they're 14-15. For example, at the very beginning of the game, you see a fictional commercial for a product called Quelorie Magic. It's endorsed by a pop star named Rise Kujikawa, stage name ""Risette"", no older than 15, who says lines like ""I'm tired of dieting and going to the gym is too hard!"" and ""Good thing there's something even I can handle!"" The satire is very subtle. (Not.)
For another example, if you date one of the girls in-game, you'll get a scene wherein it's heavily implied they and the player have sex. Related, it's entirely possible to cheat on the girls and date all of them at once, though you do get a rather scathing punishment come Valentine's Day, on which you can only spend the day with one girl.
And, most incriminatingly, one of the dungeons in the game is an exaggerated version of a Strip Club representing the aforementioned Rise's frustrations at being sexualized and marketed as a brainless ditz to the public.
That being said, all of these pale to what a 15+ year old has already heard from their peers at school.
And, hey, there's good messages, and good role models. The entire message of the game is that repressing the negative parts of yourself is unhealthy and dangerous; the heroes only gain their powers by confronting their ""Shadow"", the repressed parts of the psyche that they don't want to acknowledge. And this isn't a ""Be yourself"" thing either, these are very negative things: Your best friend feels bored with his life as it is, and his friends are holding in hidden desires to feel like a knight in shining armor, or feelings of emptiness and loneliness.
Which isn't to say they're bad people, they just have flaws, and there's nothing wrong with that. The aforementioned best friend is a responsible individual and the second-in-command of your Investigation Team. Rise is, despite mild bitterness towards the industry she used to be a part of, a very caring, positive individual.
All in all, Persona 4 isn't for your 10-year-old, not by a long shot. But it's certainly not ""inappropriate for 17 and under"" either. And it's a great game, so there's that.

"Valorant","age 14+","25 years old here:
This game is very mild in its violence. Character's catch phrases aren't anything extreme or offensive. You only play versus other people around the world. The gameplay is honestly 8-10 years old level but the communication with other players is what to watch out for.
There are options that allow you to disable voice chat which, for younger and impressionable ones I'd recommend as they can still press buttons to make visual 'callouts'.
If you child is the kind to spout random banter amongst peers and use every new word they hear then I'd err on the side of caution with voice chat. If they're responsible then it shouldn't be an issue.",""
"Valorant","age 14+","I’m a pc enthusiast, and when this game came out I was instantly hooked. The matches are quite long(40mins) for the standard, but the shorter matches are 10 mins (spike rush).

Just tell your kid to turn their mics of since it is very annoying to hear kids screaming profanities into the chat.",""
"Valorant","age 14+","This game has very little to worry about, the only problems I can list are very minor swearing, blood, and corpses but you can remove that in settings, if there was one big problem it would only be the voice chat, a lot of people in this game are weird and toxic so they can be pretty mean. Of course you can turn off voice chat and for regular chat you can turn on a filter I'm pretty sure, overall as long as your child is trustable and smart you'll be perfectly fine. Some people are saying that children can't ""play"" tactical shooters but to be honest it's likely that 90% of the community are children and a lot of them are OP.",""

When played with friends, Valorant is a great experience with good maps and fun game play. Altogether a great game other than the communities and and excessive in game purchases.

"Valorant","age 14+","You should play Valorant because the game is about having fun with your friends and being a team together and defeating other teams with teamwork and skill. The game is easy to run without gaming specs, you can have whatever settings you want, play on different cool maps and play competitively with people who are as good as you. The game is not very CPU and GPU-demanding even without gaming specs. You won’t have many stutters because the game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second. Some people like the gun on the left side instead of the right side, he can change it easily. By going to settings. Valorant has all kinds of settings. The maps are pretty detailed and cool but still very optimized. For example, Bind has teleporters from the back site from B Long to Defender Spawn. (names for spots) When you start the game, you have to play 10 unrated rounds. To play Competitive. The game is very friendly to new players.

Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Immortal, and Radiant. Valorant is a superior competitive game with all kinds of settings you would like.

"","","","25 years old here:
This game is very mild in its violence. Character's catch phrases aren't anything extreme or offensive. You only play versus other people around the world. The gameplay is honestly 8-10 years old level but the communication with other players is what to watch out for.
There are options that allow you to disable voice chat which, for younger and impressionable ones I'd recommend as they can still press buttons to make visual 'callouts'.
If you child is the kind to spout random banter amongst peers and use every new word they hear then I'd err on the side of caution with voice chat. If they're responsible then it shouldn't be an issue."
"","","","I’m a pc enthusiast, and when this game came out I was instantly hooked. The matches are quite long(40mins) for the standard, but the shorter matches are 10 mins (spike rush). This game is an animation, and if you let your kid watch Star Wars, they should be fine. Just tell your kid to turn their mics of since it is very annoying to hear kids screaming profanities into the chat."
"","","","This game has very little to worry about, the only problems I can list are very minor swearing, blood, and corpses but you can remove that in settings, if there was one big problem it would only be the voice chat, a lot of people in this game are weird and toxic so they can be pretty mean. Of course you can turn off voice chat and for regular chat you can turn on a filter I'm pretty sure, overall as long as your child is trustable and smart you'll be perfectly fine. Some people are saying that children can't ""play"" tactical shooters but to be honest it's likely that 90% of the community are children and a lot of them are OP."
"","","","Valorant is a fun shooter made for (in my opinion) ages 10 and up. The game involves animated charactors and no blood."
"","","","I think it is a lot like overwatch, if you know what that is. It’s a hero shooter we’re you pick your character and go into a game of 5v5, again much like overwatch. Lastly, the game is made by a trusted company called Riot Games, they have made many great games such as team fight tactics, league of legends, and legends of runeterra."
"","","","Valorant is a great game when you have friends to play it with. Other then minor elements of violence like blood gushes and dead bodies (that you can disable.) and some language in voice lines, the game is pretty clean. The main worry is public voice chat/ text chat (due to toxic communities.). But it defaults to disabled so you can avoid it.
When played with friends, Valorant is a great experience with good maps and fun game play. Altogether a great game other than the communities and and excessive in game purchases. (I'd also like to add that the anti cheat works by bots being able to see your files/desktop and scan them for hacks, so if there is a leak, randos will be able to see everything on your computer.) If you like the strategical fps genre Valorant is for you."
"","","","Its a fun cartoonish game where you play a capture the flag with gun that you use to send people back to there base with no blood. great, and no blood. Good teamwork too!"
"","","","Imagine carrying your team by going 24-8-5 and only getting 15 ranked up points but then the next game you go 18-11-14 and you go down 22 ranked up points. This game has a major disappointing ranked program and please do not play their competitive. Even their pro team players have stated they only see this game living for 3 more years and I completely agree. Go play Halo or BF or even CoD before you touching this garbage"

"","","","You should play Valorant because the game is about having fun with your friends and being a team together and defeating other teams with teamwork and skill. The game is easy to run without gaming specs, you can have whatever settings you want, play on different cool maps and play competitively with people who are as good as you. The game is not very CPU and GPU-demanding even without gaming specs. You won’t have many stutters because the game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second. Some people like the gun on the left side instead of the right side, he can change it easily. By going to settings. Valorant has all kinds of settings. The maps are pretty detailed and cool but still very optimized. For example, Bind has teleporters from the back site from B Long to Defender Spawn. (names for spots) When you start the game, you have to play 10 unrated rounds. To play Competitive. The game is very friendly to new players. (original game mode) If you want to get your rank, you have to play 5 games and the game will see how good you played. There are 8 ranks. Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Immortal, and Radiant. Valorant is a superior competitive game with all kinds of settings you would like. You can switch your crosshair to different sizes and different colors. Are you very good at FPS games? Then try playing Valorant and start to get your rank in Competitive and start grinding! This game is about teamwork, how good you are at the game and most of all have fun!"
"","","","I think that Valorant is a really good, In some of the over comments it talks about the game having swearing and blood and other players sometimes using excessive bad language but you can turn all of this off in the settings. Over all it is a really good game and its very similar to Apex Legends and some parents may think that this game is bad and addictive it really isn't. I know from experience there are some problems with the game length, but there are shorter modes that don't take as long"
"","","","So my kid has been wanting to play Valorant for a while now and when I look into games before my kid plays them, I watch videos of people playing the game, if the game says blood and gun violence, I want to see how bad that violence is, and frankly, it’s not. You can chat with other players that might swear, but that goes with every multiplayer game and if your kid is not swearing if that is your concern then you will be fine. Valorant is a fun and entertaining for kids to play, and I recommend it."
"","","","its a chill game turn off violence in settings"
"","","","Valorant is a great first-person team game that my son and his friends play all the time. I've watched him play many times and it brings me joy to see him playing and talking to his friends. My son is quite shy and never had many friends at school but through video games, like valorant he's become a much happier and more social kid! If parents have concerns about valorant being to violent of a game there are toggleable options such as ""show mature content"" to make the game great for all ages. I give valorant an ages 10 and up rating due to the fact that it may be to complex of a game for younger kids."
